## Features of Castle Mod APK

Castle Mod APK offers several key features that make it different from the standard version of the game. Here are some of the top features you can expect:

### 1. Unlimited Resources
One of the main attractions of the Castle Mod APK is the unlimited resources it offers. In the regular version, players need to collect resources like gold, wood, and gems to upgrade their castle and troops.

This means you can enjoy uninterrupted gaming and focus on your strategy and castle-building without distractions.

### 4. Upgraded Troops and Defenses
